## Conclusions 
What do location-related meta-keywords say about the publishing strategies in comparing two online newspapers?

Zeit tends to follow a typical strategy for Western European newspapers and establishes geographically close areas of interest. NYT has a broader outtake on geopolitics, however it is very conflict oriented. 

NYT is more granular, the geography-related keywords do not only refer to geopolitical entities and boundaries (e.g. countries), but also to natural landmarks. This results in more detailed areas of interest. 

For both newspapers, countries in the Global South are seldom covered and often on topics like sport or tourism. In certain cases, some of these countries also relate to each other by sharing climate change related keywords.
