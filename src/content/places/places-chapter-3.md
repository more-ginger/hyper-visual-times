Both visualizations offer a general overview of Die Zeit and The New York times publishing strategies, by centering the individual keywords and scaling up their relevance based on the number of articles associated with them. Another valuable approach is to work with these keywords to explore other intersecting keywords and news items published by the newspaper.  In other words, we can compare countries with one another to find out if they share common keywords or news content throughout the data. 

## Question 3: To what extent does coverage of countries overlap?

Relationships between countries can be expressed by the amount of shared coverage. In the visualization below, you can choose a pair of countries and build a comparison using a Venn diagram, which gives an impression of how many articles and keywords are shared between the two. Countries that do not share articles might still share keywords: the double comparison is necessary to display on the one hand the effective overlap of two countries (i.e. how many articles are tagged using geographical keywords associated with them) and on the other hand the fuzzier similarity that comes from shared keywords (i.e. if a keyword is mentioned at least once for both countries). 

At glance, similar patterns to the previous visualizations are reproduced. Countries traversed by conflict are heavily related with each other, and the host countries for the newspaper tend to have a lot in common with close countries. However, by exploring specific pairs, it is also possible to observe the similarities and differences between the two outlets in terms of topics.  

How to read:
In the Venn diagrams, the smaller country in the pair is always scaled in relation to the bigger country â€“ expressing the relationship between the two in terms of importance. On the right side of the screen, you can select what to look at: either the titles of shared articles or the shared keywords.
