## The Hyper-visual Times

After building a partial blueprint of the material layer of news, the chapters included in this interactive essay will dive into one particular dimension of digital news-making. The goal is to reverse the transient and ephemeral nature of digital news through the creation of distinct pictures and snapshots of news coverage. These snapshots compose a wider horizon for digital news consumption with editorial and platform-related strategies coming to the foreground in showing and comparing the rhetorical and contextual rules of selected news outlets.

<h3>The geo-politics of news</h3>
Meta-keywords are words that describe the content of digital articles for faster and better indexing within recommending systems. They range from very broad terms that repeat across articles to very specific ones that describe unique events. Among these terms, words related to geographical entities play a key role in marking coverage about places and regions in the world. This chapter focuses on how geographic keywords are used across the online coverage of two newspapers: The New York Times and Die Zeit. First, keywords that are related to geographic locations are extracted and preprocessed to reach a common standard for both publications. Then, other keywords related to these countries are extracted to investigate the overlaps and differences shown by the two newspapers in covering geo-political entities and connected topics.

<h3>Text</h3>
Articles’ titles and content have been reshaped by digital practices driven by algorithmic logics. Leaving behind purely stylistic choices like metaphors, important words and concepts need to be stated clearly and early in the title and story to facilitate crawlers in correctly identifying the core topics of the article. Using machine learning and topic modeling techniques, key terms have been extracted from one year worth of articles from The New York Times archives. As a result, we generated clusters of similar words showing how often certain topics are discussed throughout the newspaper coverage. In this chapter, these clusters have been visualized to allow for analyzing the relationships between different themes.

<h3>Images</h3>
News images influence our understanding of events (Martikainen & Sakki, 2021). This chapter focuses on images of people, as cultural artefacts built using long-established conventions of visual depictions (Griffin, 1999).
