        Journalistic convergence is the integration of news in a digital infrastructure (Pavlik, 2004). This process of assimilation does not influence only the format of news, but also the relationships between journalists and audiences on different levels. De facto, It is a remediation (Bolter & Grusin, 1999), where digital media mirrors traditional ones. For journalism, remediation happens as the newspaper moves online to become a digital product. This transformation affects journalism as a system by triggering changes at structural levels.

    <div data-step="1-map" class="step rounded-xl border p-10 w-11/12 md:w-6/12 mb-200 bg-ivory-default/75 backdrop-blur-xs">
        This map attempts to chart the impact of digitalization on the overall system of journalism by systematizing three fundamental infrastructural layers: individual, material, and societal. These three levels should be understood as different spaces at which journalism happens, with different types of actors and interdependencies creating the complex ramifications that uphold the cultural and social role of journalism. 
    </div>
    <div data-step="2-individual" class="step rounded-xl border p-10 w-11/12 md:w-6/12 mb-200 bg-ivory-default/75 backdrop-blur-xs">
        The <div class="border rounded-xl px-2 inline-flex"><img src="icons/individual.svg" class="h-[15px] mt-[3px] mr-[3px]"/><span>individual layer</span></div> describes the human dimension of journalism. Citizens and journalists are positioned on an axis that goes from usage to production. Citizens at the end of the “usage” axis are members of the audience. Journalism seeks to influence these citizens by modifying their social cognitions, such as attitudes and ideologies (van Dijk, 1995).
    </div>
    <div data-step="3-journalists" class="step rounded-xl border p-10 md:ml-0 w-11/12 md:w-6/12 mb-200 bg-ivory-default/75 backdrop-blur-xs">
        At the end of the “production” axis there are journalists, citizens able to produce journalism: authors, editors, and other figures part of the newsroom. These newsroom workers are professionalized individuals able to follow editorial guidelines and strategies to produce journalistic stories. Their ability is directly tied and influenced by internalized organizational and ethical values, which results in their authority to exercise authorship. The influences of digitalization can already be seen at this level, with a new figure positioned on the axis spanning between production and consumption. 
    </div>
    <div data-step="4-citizenj" class="step rounded-xl border p-10 md:ml-0 w-11/12 md:w-6/12 mb-200 bg-ivory-default/75 backdrop-blur-xs">
        Citizen journalists are individuals that do not formally belong to the journalistic profession but still practice forms of journalism using self-publishing techniques through online services and platforms like personal blogs and social media. These actors are rising to the foreground of journalism (Newman et al., 2025), playing into influence and online personality culture. <span class="underline--custom underline--disrupt">These figures are somewhat disruptive as they tap into authorship without necessarily agreeing to the organizational values and boundaries imposed by the newsroom as a societal institution.</span> This disruption is not necessarily negative, but sheds a light on the strong tie between the individual and society in regards to journalistic trust.The individual and societal levels closely co-exist with each other. For instance, both organizational values and publication practices are coordinated by the editorial board of the newspaper.
    </div>
    <div data-step="5-editorialb" class="step rounded-xl border p-10 md:mr-0 w-11/12 md:w-6/12 mb-200 bg-ivory-default/75 backdrop-blur-xs">
        Moreover, the direct influence of journalism on citizens causes public opinions to form as a result of the consumption of news, transforming individual readers into an audience. With the rise of digital media and citizen journalists the implicit trust granted by individuals to professionals is not given anymore.
    </div>
    <div data-step="6-societal" class="step rounded-xl border p-10 w-11/12 md:w-6/12 mb-200 bg-ivory-default/75 backdrop-blur-xs">
        At the <div class="border rounded-xl px-2 inline-flex"><img src="icons/societal.svg" class="h-[15px] mt-[3px] mr-[3px]"/>societal level</div>, journalism does not collimate in the sum of individual pieces of news or individual authorial interventions. It includes the overall corpus of coverage, past and present, as well as the entire economic, organizational, and institutional structure and actors surrounding journalism. In other words, on this layer journalism exists as a social and cultural phenomenon. 
    </div>
    <div data-step="7-stakeholders" class="step rounded-xl border p-10 w-11/12 md:w-6/12 mb-200 bg-ivory-default/75 backdrop-blur-xs">
        This is partially defined through the groups of people that are influenced by or influence the production of journalism. Arguably, the definition of these groups is only partially possible and in this context reflects the necessity to include within this picture at least a fraction of the actors related to the journalistic machine, namely direct and indirect stakeholders and the public opinion. These groups of social actors are the fundamental enabler or inhibitor of journalism and their access to its content is facilitated or gate-kept by the material manifestation of the medium.
    </div>
    <div data-step="8-platforms" class="step rounded-xl border p-10 md:md:mr-0 w-11/12 md:w-6/12 mb-200 bg-ivory-default/75 backdrop-blur-xs">
        In digital environments the extension and complexity of this layer is even greater than it used to be for traditional journalistic media. The bar for ownership is at the same time lower and higher than they used to be. Virtually anyone can own a website or a blog to publish news content, but only few centralized players own the infrastructure for circulation like social media, search engines, and AI companies. Again, this creates a disruption in the societal perception of journalistic work.
    </div>
    <div data-step="9–rules1" class="step rounded-xl border p-10 md:mr-0 w-11/12 md:w-6/12 mb-200 bg-ivory-default/75 backdrop-blur-xs">
        For one thing, we should start considering the sheer amount of news and news-adjacent content published online. This content – legitimate or not – needs to be engineered to be visible and attract readers’ attention in a space saturated with stimuli.
    </div>
    <div data-step="10–rules2" class="step rounded-xl border p-10 md:mr-0 w-11/12 md:w-6/12 mb-200 bg-ivory-default/75 backdrop-blur-xs">
        Given the externalization of platforms’ ownership, this competition happens within a specific setting and with rules that are not defined nor enforced by the editorial boards of news outlets. Authors and editors have to adapt their content to make it fit within a fixed infrastructure with opaque logics. This shift points to the renewed importance of materiality in news-making.
    </div>
        <div data-step="11–material" class="step rounded-xl border p-10 w-11/12 md:w-6/12 mb-200 bg-ivory-default/75 backdrop-blur-xs">
        Hence, within the journalistic system, the <div class="border rounded-xl px-2 inline-flex"><img src="icons/material.svg" class="h-[15px] mt-[3px] mr-[3px]"/>material layer</div> functions as a bridge between the previous two and – unlike them – is tied to specific cultural objects that serve as channels of representation and communication. Over the last centuries, this object has been the newspaper. The way articles are laid out and organized across a newspaper issue is responsible for casting the readers into specific relationships with the world and its events (Barnhurst & Nerone, 2001). Clearly, these relationships are connoted by editorial and authorial choices. However, the medium of print itself has undeniably afforded news some of its distinct material characteristics: tangibility, permanence, and linearity.
        <img class="mt-2" src="img/printing_press_wikimedia_commons.jpeg"/>
        <div class="text-xs italic my-2">

        </div>
        After all, materiality itself is the interplay between content and its form – where one of the two comes into focus depending on the performances enacted by the work (Hayles, n.d.). Over the years the affordances of print have reinforced the positioning of journalism in a place of authority within societal discourses.</div>
    <div data-step="12–material-disruption" class="step rounded-xl border p-10 w-11/12 md:w-6/12 md:mr-0 mb-200 bg-ivory-default/75 backdrop-blur-xs">
        The advent of digitalization has disrupted the linearity afforded by print. News articles have become digital objects: relational, intangible, storable, and programmable entities with a high degree of formal flexibility (Hui, 2013).
    </div>
    <div data-step="13-circulation" class="step rounded-xl border p-10 w-11/12 md:w-6/12 md:mr-0 mb-200 bg-ivory-default/75 backdrop-blur-xs">
        These aspects entirely change the forms and modes of news circulation. With circulation, we consider all the editorial strategies and material infrastructure needed to distribute news content to the public. As previously mentioned, circulation has a clear social and individual significance in the exchange and consumption of public opinion (Raetzsch & Bødker, 2016) and the material layer is where news is curated and organized in particular constellations to facilitate its circulation and penetration in the public discourse. Arguably, the digital medium has very different requirements for the circulation of news. In particular, linearity has been exchanged with immediacy and relationality: news items can be rapidly accessed from different locations, linked to other online content, and ultimately extracted from their original context.
    </div>
    <div data-step="14–circulation-platforms" class="step rounded-xl border p-10 md:mr-0 w-11/12 md:w-6/12 mb-200 bg-ivory-default/75 backdrop-blur-xs">
        In digital environments the circulation of news (and consequently its presence and relevance in our everyday lives) is not solely dictated by the editorial processes internal to the newspaper and the channel of distribution, but is subject to the external logics of web platforms such as search engines and social media. Broadly defined, digital platforms are modular environments capable of deploying third-party content into products based on clients’ demand (Hein et al., 2020). In other words, digital platforms are hyper-flexible containers of digital objects capable of reshaping themselves on human input. One common example of a digital platform is the search engine google.com, that indexes web content based on users’ search prompts allegedly returning the best match for any search.</div>
    <div data-step="15-seo" class="step rounded-xl border p-10 md:ml-0  w-11/12 md:w-6/12 mb-200 bg-ivory-default/75 backdrop-blur-xs">
        These external dependencies fundamentally reshape the ways news is produced and consumed in many ways. First and foremost because digital platforms are largely based on a transaction of data between service provider and client, with products becoming increasingly personalized as the customer provides data about themselves and their habits. This entails the need for standard practices to collect information, which effectively change the way news is written and distributed online. For instance, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) practices have become foundational guidelines to digital news as much as the “five W’s of journalism” rule (Richmond, 2008). These practices are engineered to push news content to the top of a search engine’s page and are based on the simple assumption that automated bots and crawlers visiting web pages need to easily identify content, including its main topics and key terms.
    </div>
    <div data-step="16-titles" class="step rounded-xl border p-10 md:ml-0  w-11/12 md:w-6/12 mb-200 bg-ivory-default/75 backdrop-blur-xs">
        Consequently, writing has to be remodeled following specific stylistic constraints. Titles need to be simple and must contain clear terms, stylistic nuances like metaphors should be avoided (ibid.). A news item where SEO strategies are successfully implemented has a better chance to be seen by readers. In certain cases, this creates two different versions of the same article: one for print and one for digital distribution.
    </div>
    <div data-step="17-standard" class="step rounded-xl border p-10 md:ml-0  w-11/12 md:w-6/12 mb-200 bg-ivory-default/75 backdrop-blur-xs">
        This example shows how the new material layer of journalism is now organized around the creation of standardized datasets of news, where each item presents a clear structure of content and metadata to facilitate its propagation across platforms. Content needs to be interpretable for humans and machines alike, with the latter being almost as important as the former.
    </div>
    <div data-step="18-layers" class="step rounded-xl border p-10 md:ml-0 w-11/12 md:w-6/12 mb-100 bg-ivory-default/75 backdrop-blur-xs">
        In this sense, digital news has to exist on two layers: the layer of content, designed for humans, and the layer of metadata, designed for machines. These two layers are not independent from each other, but coexist and merge in the tangible representation of digital articles.
    </div>
    <div data-step="19-content" class="step rounded-xl border p-10 md:ml-0 w-11/12 md:w-6/12 mb-100 bg-ivory-default/75 backdrop-blur-xs">
        The content layer is rendered through our devices’ viewport and is widely heterogeneous in terms of formats: news articles are written text, audio podcasts, short video snippets or long video essays, as well as stories combining interactive elements, data, and multimedia artifacts.
    </div>
    <div data-step="20-metadata" class="step rounded-xl border p-10 md:ml-0 w-11/12 md:w-6/12 mb-100 bg-ivory-default/75 backdrop-blur-xs">
        On the metadata layer, news is tightly structured independently from its format: machines are provided with publication timestamps, descriptive keywords, text snippets, and representative images. Each of these properties is the result of a careful editorial process, where the necessary aspects for encoding the information to make it machine-readable are embedded as part of the content.
    </div>
    <div data-step="21-decoding" class="step rounded-xl border p-10 md:ml-0 w-11/12 md:w-6/12 mb-100 bg-ivory-default/75 backdrop-blur-xs">
        Using these pieces of data, modern browsers and platforms are able to decode and show content in different formats to the final user through the device viewport. These properties are not confined to the domain of metadata, but often made visible to readers, even used to personalize content, with specific news items being displayed over others or programmatic advertisements placed at specific points of the page.
    </div>
    <div data-step="22-traces" class="step rounded-xl border p-10 md:ml-0 w-11/12 md:w-6/12 mb-100 bg-ivory-default/75 backdrop-blur-xs">
            The digital traces left behind from this layer of data impact the reading experience of audience members. For instance, descriptive keywords are a feature primarily engineered to support internal indexing of articles. 
    </div>
    <div data-step="23-influence" class="step rounded-xl border p-10 md:ml-0 w-11/12 md:w-6/12 mb-100 bg-ivory-default/75 backdrop-blur-xs">
            However – once displayed – theymight support in steering the reader’s interests and priorities in navigating through content. 
    </div>
    <div data-step="24-consequences" class="step rounded-xl border p-10 md:ml-0 w-11/12 md:w-6/12 bg-ivory-default/75 backdrop-blur-xs">
            Moreover, unlike individual and societal aspects of digital news consumption, these traces are resilient and cross-culturally standardized due to their adherence to external infrastructures of circulation. In other words, the metadata layer of digital news is useful to visualize its broader consequences on individual readers.
