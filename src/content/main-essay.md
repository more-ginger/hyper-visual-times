# Who will watch the watchmen?

<div data-step="0" class="step">This website contains a series of experiments with digital news. In contrast to its past made of ink and paper, digital news is a volatile, lightweight, and ambiguous item. News has absorbed the characteristics and affordances of digital media and these affordances are remodeling the social and cultural role of news and journalism at large. The digital has become the main infrastructure for news circulation, with consequences on the cultural forms of journalism, intended as its textual, institutional, material and technological manifestations (BÃ¸dker, 2015). Across the chapters of this website, the material and technological forms of digital journalism come to the forefront, through the different aspects encoded in digital news and compiled into editorial strategies for online circulation. These aspects are not secondary forces in building the epistemic credibility of journalism (Carlson, 2020), and ultimately they influence the way discourse yet they are difficult to observe and disentangle. Individual news consumption happens at a mesoscopic level. For instance, as readers, we are able to consume one individual article. We absorb the point of view of one author, within the editorial boundaries of one specific news outlet. However, the way digital news is published and archived would allow us to go beyond the boundaries of individual consumption. What happens on different scales? How do certain narratives unfold at a microscopic or macroscopic level?</div>
