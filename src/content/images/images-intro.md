### This chapter focuses on a quantitative analysis of the appearance of public figures in article teaser images in Zeit Online and The New York Times. Persons in article teaser images of both newspapers were extracted, grouped and labelled manually. The resulting dataset was used to investigate the temporal contexts of a person's appearance and their co-appearances with other public figures.

Images and especially photographs, sometimes collaged, have become an integral part of the news form. However, the perceived objectivity of images in journalism has gradually changed, moving from didascalic representation of events to constructing narratives, evoking emotions and generating engagement (Barnhurst and Nerone, 2001). Contemporary theories emphasize this epistemic transition and oppose the idea of  images as objective accounts of reality (Sontag, 1977). This understanding of newsworthy images becomes especially relevant in the context of political journalism. Vos and Van Aelst (2017) have shown that differences in political systems  influence the quantity and  diversity of news coverage on national politicians. In proportional election systems journalistic coverage is more diverse than in majoritarian systems, due to local politicians still enjoying good visibility over the national political scene. Latching on this discourse, this chapter explores how politicians are represented across Zeit Online and The New York Times: 

*What political figures are represented the most across the two news outlets?*

*How is the local political system influencing the selection of images?*

*Is it possible to register the political alignment of news outlets by analysing patterns of representation?*

To investigate these questions, we conducted a quantitative analysis of the appearances of public figures in teaser images of <span class="zeit">Zeit Online</span> and <span class="nyt">The New York Times</span>. First, we used a pre-trained machine learning model for face recognition to find images containing human faces. Then we isolated single faces and indexed them to use them as data Lastly, the images were algorithmically clustered and manually labeled. The result is a comprehensive dataset including hundreds of actors that are part of the coverage from the two newspapers. Given the focus on politics, in the essay we isolated the top 15 represented political figures with their correspondent articles.
