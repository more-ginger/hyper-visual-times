### This chapter focuses on a quanitative analysis of the appearance of public figures in article teaser images. First, faces were dissected from the teaser images and grouped, which created catalogues of images of the same person. This dataset was used to investigate the 

Images and especially photographies have become an integral part of the news form. However, the role of images in journalism has broadened: from reporting events to constructing narrative, evoking emotion and generating engagement. The purpose of images has shifted from their usage as "objective accounts" of reality, to an increasingly aesthetic and commercial aspect, focusing on attracting  readers (Barnhurst and Nerone, 2001). Furthermore, this shift to "visual news" has prompted the creation of metrics for image selection in news rooms (Rössler et al., 2011). These metrics determine which image holds the most emotionality or aesthetic, to boost engagements.  In this regard, the concept of spectatorship has taken a central role in the motivation to use images in newspapers, driving further the commodification of news, as images carry drama, emotionality and increase market appeal (Sontag, 1977). 

But how does the underlying process play out in specific newspapers? How do political leaning and performance factors drive news rooms in their image selection? To investigate these questions, we have we have conducted a quantitative analysis of the usage of images of public figures depicted in article teaser images of <span class="zeit">Zeit Online</span> and <span class="nyt">The New York Times</span>. To analyze the content of the images we first used a machine learning model to find the faces in the images and cut them out to have them separated. Afterwards the images were grouped automatically by visual similarity and labeled manually. As a result we found the top 15 represented people that were present in each newspaper.
