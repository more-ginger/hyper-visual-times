## Conclusion

<div id="places-outro"><p markdown=1>Overall the picture painted by the two news outlets are very similar. Countries in the global West receive particular attention from both news outlets. This is not only shown by the sheer amount of coverage they receive, but also by the wider networks that these countries cast throughout coverage. This is particularly evident for <span class="zeit">Zeit Online</span>, where the politics of European countries and the USA are very central to the coverage. <span class="nyt">The New York Times</span> has a slightly broader outlook, including coverage about less represented countries. However, on a second look, many of these instances are articles concerned with either sport events or tourism – as in the case of Morocco. These articles present a very interesting dynamic proper to online news content: the item is tagged with a deluge of keywords in what looks like an attempt to maximize its reach and use it as a gateway to bring readers on the website.

Both news outlets are very conflict oriented. The majority of geopolitical coverage has to do with armed conflict, followed by international politics, and trade. Countries in the Global South are also often covered solely in relation to disease, climate change, or tourism. Global South and Global North are mainly connected with each other through the topic of migration. Ultimately, the two news outlets seem to be largely aligned, showing a rather clear picture of a central Global Western world and a marginalized rest. Only the topic of climate is more visibly present in <span class="nyt">The New York Times</span> coverage than in <span class="zeit">Zeit Online</span>, establishing new connections between countries that otherwise would have little common overlap and bringing forward a more recent major branch of discourse: climate geo-politics in the face of the environmental crisis.</p></div>
