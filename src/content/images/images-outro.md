<h2 class="pb-4 font-serif text-xl">Conclusion</h2>
Our analysis demonstrates that the visual representation of political actors in <span class="zeit">Zeit Online</span> and <span class="nyt">The New York Times</span> is shaped by substantial different editorial priorities and political environments. While both newspapers rely extensively on images to construct narratives, the underlying patterns of who appears—and with whom—reveal distinct forms of visual political storytelling.

In both outlets, government officials and central political figures are disproportionately visible compared to actors from other domains, underscoring the role of visual media in reinforcing hierarchies of political relevance. Yet the thematic focus of this visibility diverges sharply. <span class="zeit">Zeit Online</span> prioritizes domestic politics, repeatedly featuring German government actors and opposition leaders. Its co-appearance patterns highlight the internal dynamics of coalition governance, partisan competition, and regional political networks. International actors, including figures central to global conflicts, appear largely in relation to Germany’s role within these events.

<span class="nyt">The New York Times</span>, by contrast, uses images to foreground the drama of the U.S. presidential election and the extraordinary legal entanglements surrounding Donald Trump. Visual pairings, especially the frequent juxtaposition of Trump with his lawyer Todd Blanche or with electoral rivals, reflect a political landscape dominated by litigation, campaign strategy, and institutional friction. Foreign policy actors appear mainly in moments of diplomatic crisis, illustrating a more episodic approach to international political representation.

Taken together, these findings show that visual journalism does not merely document political reality but actively participates in its construction. Through selective visibility and strategic co-appearance, each newspaper assembles a coherent visual narrative: one focused on coalition politics and domestic governance in the German case, and one structured around electoral contestation, political polarization, and legal spectacle in the U.S. context.

Ultimately, the comparative analysis highlights how images operate as a powerful discursive tool, shaping public understanding not only of individual actors, but of the relationships, conflicts, and political frameworks within which they are embedded.
