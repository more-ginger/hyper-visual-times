			After building a partial blueprint of the material layer of news, the chapters included in
			this interactive essay will dive into one particular dimension of digital news-making. The
			goal is to reverse the transient and ephemeral nature of digital news through the creation of
			distinct pictures and snapshots of news coverage. These snapshots compose a wider horizon for
			digital news consumption with editorial and platform-related strategies coming to the
			foreground in showing and comparing the rhetorical and contextual rules of selected news
			outlets.

					<p>
						This chapter focuses on how geographic keywords are used across the online coverage of
						two newspapers: The New York Times and Zeit Online. First, keywords that are related to
						geographic locations are extracted and preprocessed to reach a common standard for both
						publications. Then, other keywords related to these countries are extracted to
						investigate the overlaps and differences shown by the two newspapers in covering
						geo-political issues.

					<h2 class="my-2 font-serif text-lg">Discoursive interrelations</h2>
					<p>
						Using machine learning and topic modeling techniques, key terms have been extracted from
						one year worth of articles from The New York Times archives. As a result, we generated
						clusters of similar words showing how often certain topics are discussed throughout the
						newspaper coverage. In this chapter, these clusters have been visualized to allow for
						analyzing the relationships between different themes.

					<h2 class="my-2 font-serif text-lg">The language of images</h2>
					<p>
						This chapter focuses on images of people as cultural artefacts built using
						long-established conventions of visual depictions. By extracting facial features from
						one year Zeit Online and The New York Times coverage, only images depicting famous
						people (politicians, actors, etc.) have been retained. The visualizations show how
						frequently certain subjects are shown and what rhetorical devices are applied in
						depicting them.
