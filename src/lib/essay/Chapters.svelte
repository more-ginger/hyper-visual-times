		After building a partial blueprint of the material layer of news, the chapters included in this
		interactive essay will dive into one particular dimension of digital news-making. The goal is to
		reverse the transient and ephemeral nature of digital news through the creation of distinct
		pictures and snapshots of news coverage. These snapshots compose a wider horizon for digital
		news consumption with editorial and platform-related strategies coming to the foreground in
		showing and comparing the rhetorical and contextual rules of selected news outlets.

				<div class="mb-2">
					This chapter focuses on how geographic keywords are used across the online coverage of two
					newspapers: The New York Times and Zeit Online. First, keywords that are related to
					geographic locations are extracted and preprocessed to reach a common standard for both
					publications. Then, other keywords related to these countries are extracted to investigate
					the overlaps and differences shown by the two newspapers in covering geo-political issues.

				<h3 class="my-2 pb-0">Discoursive interrelations</h3>
				Using machine learning and topic modeling techniques, key terms have been extracted from one
				year worth of articles from The New York Times archives. As a result, we generated clusters of
				similar words showing how often certain topics are discussed throughout the newspaper coverage.
				In this chapter, these clusters have been visualized to allow for analyzing the relationships
				between different themes.

				<h3 class="my-2 pb-0">The language of images</h3>
				This chapter focuses on images of people as cultural artefacts built using long-established conventions
				of visual depictions. By extracting facial features from one year Zeit Online and The New York
				Times coverage, only images depicting famous people (politicians, actors, etc.) have been retained.
				The visualizations show how frequently certain subjects are shown and what rhetorical devices
				are applied in depicting them.
