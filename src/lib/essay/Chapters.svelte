			After building a partial blueprint of the material layer of news, the chapters included in
			this interactive essay will dive into one particular dimension of digital news-making. The
			goal is to reverse the transient and ephemeral nature of digital news through the creation of
			distinct pictures and snapshots of news coverage. These snapshots compose a wider horizon for
			digital news consumption with editorial and platform-related strategies coming to the
			foreground in showing and comparing the rhetorical and contextual rules of selected news
			outlets.

					This chapter focuses on how geographic keywords are used across the online coverage of two
					newspapers: The New York Times and Zeit Online. First, keywords that are related to
					geographic locations are extracted and preprocessed to reach a common standard for both
					publications. Then, other keywords related to these countries are extracted to investigate
					the overlaps and differences shown by the two newspapers in covering geo-political issues.

					Using machine learning and topic modeling techniques, key terms have been extracted from
					one year worth of articles from The New York Times archives. As a result, we generated
					clusters of similar words showing how often certain topics are discussed throughout the
					newspaper coverage. In this chapter, these clusters have been visualized to allow for
					analyzing the relationships between different themes.

					This chapter focuses on images of people as cultural artefacts built using
					long-established conventions of visual depictions. By extracting facial features from one
					year Zeit Online and The New York Times coverage, only images depicting famous people
					(politicians, actors, etc.) have been retained. The visualizations show how frequently
					certain subjects are shown and what rhetorical devices are applied in depicting them.
